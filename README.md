# <center>AzureFlare</center>
AzureFlare is a drop in DLL mod for the official PSOBB client to allow for modifications without the need to edit PsoBB.exe, focused on compatibility with the official client rather than modifications such as the Teth executables.

## What it can do?
At the time of writing this README:
* Server redirection for US, JP, Ep4 and CN modes respectively
* GameGuard bypass (Both packed and unpacked EXE)
* Allow changing the language of the game so it can load the US localization
* Allow writing in game chat without the need of installing a Japanese IME
* Enabling or disabling Episode 4 mode

## What it won't do?
Anything that is compatible with only Teth executables. For patches concerning them, there's [Solybum's Blue Burst Patch Project](https://github.com/Solybum/Blue-Burst-Patch-Project) (I just wanted to plug that project, it needs some recognition).

## To do
* Tell me!

## Why AzureFlare?
I looked for synonyms of Blue and Burst repectively and took 2 at random.
