# <center>AzureFlare</center>
AzureFlare is a drop in dll mod for the official PSOBB client to allow for modifications without the need to edit PsoBB.exe, focused on compatibility with the official client rather than modifications such as the Teth executables.

## What it can do?
At the time of writing this README:
* Server redirection for US, JP, Ep4 and CN modes respectively.

## To do
* GameGuard bypass (The official client can't start without as it tries to connect to a nonexistent server)

## Why AzureFlare?
I looked for synonyms of Blue and Burst repectively and took 2 at random.
